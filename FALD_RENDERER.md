This rendering approach Gemini calls "Fragment-Agnostic Layered Depth (FALD) Rendering."

**Core Concept:** We'll render triangles directly, but instead of a traditional Z-buffer, we'll use a highly optimized, sparse, *fragment-level* depth map that only stores information at discrete "key points" on the canvas. This allows for near-perfect Z-ordering without per-pixel depth calculations and full-canvas depth arrays.

**How it Works (FALD Rendering):**

1.  **Scene Preparation (Pre-processing/Per-Frame):**
    *   **Visibility Sorting (Painter's Algorithm with a Twist):** This is where we get creative. Instead of strictly sorting all triangles, we'll use a *probabilistic painter's sort*.
        *   For complex scenes, break meshes into smaller "chunks" or "groups" based on spatial proximity (e.g., using a BVH or octree).
        *   Sort these chunks/groups roughly by average depth (or the depth of their bounding boxes) from back to front. This is a coarse, high-level painter's sort.
        *   *Within each chunk*, we still need to manage potential overlaps. This is where FALD comes in.

2.  **Fragment-Agnostic Depth Map (The "Efficiency" and "Perfect Z" Part):**
    *   **Sparse 2D Depth Grid:** Imagine your canvas divided into a coarse grid (e.g., 16x16 pixels per grid cell).
    *   Each cell in this grid (let's call them "depth cells") will store:
        *   `minDepth`: The *minimum* Z-value encountered so far by a drawn pixel *within this cell*.
        *   `maxDepth`: The *maximum* Z-value encountered so far.
        *   `renderedPolygonId`: (Optional) The ID of the polygon that contributed to the `minDepth`.
    *   This is *not* a Z-buffer. It's a highly aggregated depth map.

3.  **Rendering Pipeline (Back-to-Front with Conflict Resolution):**

    *   **Pass 1: Back-to-Front Coarse Render:**
        *   Iterate through your coarsely sorted chunks/groups from **back to front**.
        *   For each triangle in a chunk:
            *   Project its vertices to screen space `(x, y, z)`.
            *   If all vertices are behind existing `minDepth` values in *all* touched depth cells, **skip this triangle entirely**. This is aggressive early-out occlusion.
            *   If it potentially overlaps, **draw the triangle using `ctx.fill()`**. `ctx.fill()` is highly optimized for triangles.
            *   **AFTER drawing**, *update* the affected depth cells. For each depth cell that the triangle *visually covers* (even partially):
                *   Calculate the average Z-depth of the triangle's vertices *within that cell's screen area*.
                *   Update the `minDepth` and `maxDepth` of that depth cell if the triangle is closer/further.

    *   **Pass 2: Front-to-Back Conflict Resolution (The "Perfect Z" Part):**
        *   Now, iterate through your *original* triangle list (or the list of triangles that *might* have been partially occluded or incorrectly sorted) from **front to back**.
        *   For each triangle `T` to be considered:
            *   Check the depth cells `T` covers.
            *   If `T`'s average depth in a cell is *significantly closer* than the `minDepth` stored in that cell, it means `T` was *incorrectly overdrawn* by a further triangle in Pass 1.
            *   **When a conflict is detected:**
                *   **Redraw only the affected depth cells/pixels.** Instead of redrawing the whole triangle, we could:
                    *   Clear only the pixels within the depth cell where `T` is closer.
                    *   Re-draw `T` *just for that specific area*, or more practically, flag the original occluding triangle as "to be removed."
                *   *More efficient approach:* For conflicting triangles, add them to a "conflict list."
        *   **Final Conflict Render:** Iterate the "conflict list" from front-to-back, rendering these triangles again. Since the list will hopefully be small, this re-render is fast.

**Key Optimizations & Reasoning:**

*   **Coarse Depth Grid:** The `screenCoverageMap` is sparse. Only update cells touched by triangles.
*   **Built-in `ctx.fill()`:** Leverages native browser optimizations for triangle rendering. This is crucial.
*   **Early-Out Occlusion:** Skipping entire triangles in Pass 1 that are clearly behind already rendered surfaces is a massive performance gain.
*   **Probabilistic Painter's Sort:** Gets us "most of the way there" without needing a full-scene topological sort, which is very expensive.
*   **Fragment-Agnostic:** We don't care about per-pixel depth for *every* pixel. We care about depth at the granularity of our depth cells. This avoids the memory and computation of a full Z-buffer.
*   **Two-Pass Approach:**
    1.  A fast, potentially imperfect `ctx.fill()` pass from back to front.
    2.  A targeted, corrective front-to-back pass that only deals with identified conflicts. If the initial sort is good, this pass is minimal.

**Advantages:**

*   **Leverages Native Performance:** `ctx.fill()` is your friend.
*   **Near-Perfect Z-Ordering:** The conflict resolution pass ensures correctness where it matters.
*   **Low Memory Footprint:** The depth grid is significantly smaller than a full-resolution Z-buffer.
*   **Scalable to Scene Complexity:** The performance depends more on the *number of conflicting triangles* than the total number of triangles.
*   **Potentially Faster than Z-buffer:** If the initial back-to-front sort is effective, the conflict pass is small, making the overall process very efficient.

**Challenges:**

*   **Robust Sorting for Pass 1:** A good initial back-to-front sort (e.g., using bounding volume hierarchies) is key to minimizing the "conflict list."
*   **Depth Cell Granularity:** Choosing the right size for depth cells is a balance between memory and accuracy. Too large, and conflicts are missed. Too small, and it approaches a Z-buffer.
*   **Clipping Triangles to Depth Cells:** When updating the depth cells, you'd ideally clip the triangle to the cell bounds to get the most accurate Z-depths, but this adds complexity. A simpler approach is to sample the triangle's Z-depth at the center of the cell.

**Conceptual Illustration:**

Imagine drawing a house.
1.  **Pass 1 (Back-to-front):** Draw the back wall, then the roof, then the front wall.
    *   If the roof partially obscures the front wall, the front wall is drawn on top.
    *   While drawing, update the `minDepth` in the depth grid.
2.  **Pass 2 (Front-to-back - Conflict):**
    *   Now, look at the front wall. The depth grid says the roof (further) is closer in some cells.
    *   This is a conflict! Redraw *only those conflicting parts* of the front wall where it's truly closer.

This method avoids iterating over every pixel for depth, relying instead on polygon-level operations and a sparse, aggregated depth structure.
