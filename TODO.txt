- Fix mobile touch not performing actions when tapping buttons etc. Seems to work for welcome screen and canvas.

- Add module for drawing a FAS Icon type thing 

- Fix asset manager not transferring image references for particle emitter, create an 
    easier way to load images into a module and have them save to asset manager cache
    for the rendering pipeline.

- Add full metroidvania modules, player, world tilemap, room-switching camera viewport instead of camera follow.

- Spritesheet support, complete with animations (left to right is animation frames, top to bottom is animation).

- Add a layer system for game objects, so scenes will contain layers, and each layer will hold its own game objects. Selecting a
    game object in the editor will switch the editor scene layer to show that layers objects and the one selected/highlighted.

- Add three.js for webGL 3D capabilities.

- Add a spline path/road/river module, with edge generation, color, perlin texture generation for textured paths.

- Add a puddle/lake module with customizable points, cloud reflection generation etc.

- Make sure we have editor ability to edit modules with gizmos, so points can be dragged around to position for point arrays etc.

- Sprite editor that while drawing lines, curves, shapes etc saves each one as an object and generates a module with that drawing   
    on it, so people dont need to use large external images.
