- Fix mobile touch not performing actions when tapping buttons etc. Seems to work for welcome screen and canvas.

- Add full metroidvania modules, player, world tilemap, room-switching camera viewport instead of camera follow.

- Add three.js for webGL 3D capabilities.

- Add a spline path/road/river module, with edge generation, color, perlin texture generation for textured paths.

- Add a puddle/lake module with customizable points, fake cloud reflection generation etc.

- Make sure we have editor ability to edit modules with gizmos, so points can be dragged around to position for point arrays etc, so adding a module with spline, the
user will be able to manipulate the spline in the editor, updating its values.

- Update documentation to better reflect the app. Update templates for modules to use JSON serialization properly

- Fix export to zip not referencing assets correctly. Single HTML works fine, but has file size limits

- Add other modules as asset packs to keep export file size to a minimum

- Add module asset pack for a canvas that can snap to the viewport position and size, and drawing modules to accompany it 

- Add a property type for code, so people can have custom code run on events within their module

- Make drawing modules start with their game object width and height as size
