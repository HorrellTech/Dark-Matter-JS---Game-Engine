# Mesh3D Updates - Face Winding Fixes & New Shapes

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive updates made to `Mesh3D.js` to fix face winding issues and add new shape types with advanced features.

---

## 1. Face Winding Fixes

All shapes now use consistent **counter-clockwise face winding** when viewed from outside the mesh. This ensures proper backface culling and consistent rendering.

### Fixed Shapes:

#### **Cube**
- All 6 faces now properly wound counter-clockwise from exterior
- Faces: back, front, left, right, top, bottom

#### **Pyramid**
- Base face wound for bottom viewing
- All 4 side triangular faces wound correctly

#### **Octahedron**  
- All 8 triangular faces (4 top, 4 bottom) properly wound

#### **Torus**
- **Fixed missing polygons** by correcting index wrapping in minor segments
- Fixed face winding to be counter-clockwise from outside
- Now generates complete, seamless torus geometry

#### **Cone**
- Base face wound for viewing from below
- Side triangular faces wound counter-clockwise from outside

#### **Cylinder**
- Bottom cap wound for exterior viewing from below
- Top cap wound for exterior viewing from above  
- Side faces properly wound around circumference

## 2. New Shape Types

### **Quad (Subdivided Plane)**
A flat rectangular plane with configurable subdivisions for creating terrain, grids, or deformable surfaces.

**Properties:**
- `quadWidth` - Width of the quad (10-500, default: 200)
- `quadHeight` - Height of the quad (10-500, default: 200)
- `quadSubdivisionsX` - X-axis subdivisions (1-20, default: 4)
- `quadSubdivisionsY` - Y-axis subdivisions (1-20, default: 4)

**Use Cases:**
- Terrain meshes
- Grid surfaces
- Cloth simulation
- Particle planes

---

### **Plane**
A simple, single-quad flat surface without subdivisions.

**Properties:**
- `planeSize` - Size of the plane (10-500, default: 200)

**Use Cases:**
- Simple ground planes
- Billboards
- UI surfaces in 3D

---

### **Custom Editable Model** ⭐
An interactive sphere-based mesh that allows users to manipulate vertices in real-time!

**Features:**
- Starts as a sphere with configurable radius and detail
- **Green squares** rendered at each vertex as handles
- **Click and drag vertices** to deform the mesh
- **Yellow highlight** for selected vertex
- Stores original vertices for potential reset

**Properties:**
- `sphereRadius` - Base sphere radius (10-500, default: 100)
- `sphereDetail` - Detail level / subdivisions (6-24, default: 6)

**Interaction System:**
- `onMouseDown()` - Select vertex by clicking near handle
- `onMouseMove()` - Drag selected vertex in screen space
- `onMouseUp()` - Release vertex
- `resetCustomModel()` - Reset to original sphere shape
- `update()` - Handles input each frame

**Visual Feedback:**
- Green squares at each vertex (8x8 pixels)
- Selected vertex turns yellow with red outline
- White outline on unselected vertices

**Use Cases:**
- Custom mesh creation tool
- Sculpting interface
- Procedural shape design
- Learning tool for understanding 3D mesh topology

## 3. Technical Implementation

### Vertex Handle Rendering
```javascript
drawVertexHandles(ctx, camera) {
    // Projects all vertices to screen space
    // Draws green/yellow squares at each vertex
    // Highlights selected vertex
}
```

### Mouse Interaction
```javascript
// Detect vertex clicks within handle radius
onMouseDown(mouseX, mouseY) // Returns true if vertex selected

// Move vertex in world space based on mouse delta
onMouseMove(mouseX, mouseY, deltaX, deltaY) // Returns true if vertex moved

// Release vertex
onMouseUp() // Returns true if was dragging
```

### Input Handling
The custom model automatically handles input through the `update()` method, which:
1. Gets the input manager from the scene
2. Checks for mouse down/move/up events
3. Calls appropriate interaction methods
4. Updates vertex positions in real-time

---

## 4. Shape Selection

All shapes now available in the shape enum:
- `cube`
- `pyramid`
- `sphere`
- `octahedron`
- `torus`
- `cone`
- `cylinder`
- `icosahedron`
- `quad` ⭐ NEW
- `plane` ⭐ NEW
- `custom` ⭐ NEW

---

## 5. Serialization

All new properties are properly serialized/deserialized:
- Quad dimensions and subdivisions
- Plane size
- Custom model state (isCustomModel, originalVertices)

---

## 6. Inspector UI Integration

The `style()` method now includes color-coded settings groups for:
- **Quad Settings** (purple background)
- **Plane Settings** (light blue background)
- **Custom Model Settings** (yellow background)

Each group contains relevant properties with proper min/max ranges and step values.

---

## 7. Coordinate System

The system uses a **Z-up right-handed coordinate system**:
- **X-axis**: Forward/Back (Red)
- **Y-axis**: Left/Right (Blue)  
- **Z-axis**: Up/Down (Green)

Face winding follows the right-hand rule for consistent normals pointing outward.

---

## 8. Usage Examples

### Creating a Subdivided Quad
```javascript
mesh.shape = "quad";
mesh.quadWidth = 300;
mesh.quadHeight = 200;
mesh.quadSubdivisionsX = 10;
mesh.quadSubdivisionsY = 8;
```

### Creating a Custom Editable Model
```javascript
mesh.shape = "custom";
mesh.sphereRadius = 150;
mesh.sphereDetail = 8;
// Users can now click and drag vertices!
```

### Using the Plane
```javascript
mesh.shape = "plane";
mesh.planeSize = 250;
```

---

## 9. Known Considerations

### Custom Model Vertex Movement
- Currently moves vertices in screen space (X/Y)
- For full 3D manipulation, implement unprojection to move in camera-relative space
- Consider adding vertex depth movement with modifier keys (Shift/Ctrl)

### Performance
- Custom model with high detail levels (>12) may have many vertex handles
- Consider LOD system for handle rendering with many vertices
- Torus with high segment counts generates many polygons

### Future Enhancements
- Add "Smooth" vs "Flat" shading option
- Implement undo/redo for custom model editing
- Add vertex snapping/constraints
- Export custom model to JSON format
- Import custom models from external formats

---

## 10. Testing Recommendations

1. **Test all shapes** to verify proper face rendering
2. **Test torus** at various segment counts to confirm no missing polygons
3. **Test custom model** vertex dragging with different detail levels
4. **Test serialization** by saving/loading scenes with new shapes
5. **Test with different cameras** (FlyCamera, TopDownCamera, etc.)
